Memory Game
===========

- I coded this game when I was a JavaScript beginner.
- You can play it [here](https://musakarakas.github.io/memory-game).
- Do not read the code to learn something.
- It's probably full of bad practices.
- For now, I don't have time to clean the code.
- Hopefully sometime in the future I will.
- Have fun!
